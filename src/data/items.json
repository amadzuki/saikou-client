The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the 'Phone Microwave,' which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.</p><p>Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.</p><p>Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality.
